Wiktionary is a wiki, which means that you can edit it, and all the content is dual-licensed under both the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License and the GNU Free Documentation License. Before you contribute, you may wish to read through some of our help pages, and bear in mind that we do things quite differently from other wikis. In particular, we have strict layout conventions and inclusion criteria.
